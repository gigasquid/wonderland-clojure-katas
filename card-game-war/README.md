The rules of this card game are quite simple.

- There are two players.
- The cards are all dealt equally to each player.
- Each round, player 1 lays a card down face up at the same time that
  player 2 lays a card down face up.  Whoever has the highest value
  card, wins both round and takes both cards.
- The winning cards are added to the bottom of the winners deck.
- Aces are high.
- If both cards are of equal value, then the winner is decided upon by
  the highest suit.  The suits ranks in order of ascending value are
  spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts.
- The player that runs out of cards loses.
