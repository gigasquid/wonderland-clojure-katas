# doublets

This Clojure Kata comes from _Alice in Wonderland_'s author, Lewis
Carroll. He came up with this word puzzle that he named _Doublets_.

The puzzle is to take two words of the same length and find a way of linking the
first word to the second word by only changing one letter at a time.  At the end of the transformation,
there will be a collections of words that show the beginning word being changed
into the ending word, one letter at a time.  All the _word links_ must be in Lewis Carroll's own words:

```
... it is de rigueur that the links should be English words, such as might be used in good society.
```

Also the _word links_ should be words that are found in the dictionary.  No proper nouns.

Here are some examples.

The Doublet of DOOR to LOCK is:

```
door
boor
book
look
lock
```

The Doublet of BANK to LOAN is:

```
bank
bonk
book
look
loon
loan
```

The Doublet of WHEAT into BREAD is:

```
wheat
cheat
cheap
cheep
creep
creed
breed
bread
```



## Instructions

- Clone or fork this repo
- `cd doublets`
- Run the tests with `lein test`
- Make the tests pass!

A sample dictionary has been included with a few words to get things going.  After you solve the kata, you might want to try a bigger dictionary to discover more exciting doublets.

## Hints

This kata is a bit tricky.  You might want to start off with a really small dictionary, (like just the word link solutions) and make it pass from there.

Also don't be shy looking for other libraries or tools to help you.
